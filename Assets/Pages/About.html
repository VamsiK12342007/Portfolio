<div class="aboutmoreinfo">
    <p>I am film guaduate from SAIT Polytechnic in Calgary. I am graduated from 
        the school in 2013 and since then, I have made some short films and a web 
        series. Some of the films have gotten into some fim festivels and won some 
        wards. But, when COVID hit on 2020, I stopped doing films because lockdown 
        and after not doing anything for years, I decided to go back to school for 
        design since, I have always been interested in design.</p>

    <p>So that's where I am currently in second year. By going doing this program, 
        I have gained a lot skills related to design and some skills in web design & 
        some web development as well. And apart from those, I also gained mores skills
         related to video prodcution as well.</p>

    <p>So, after I finish this program and graduate, I hoping to work as graphic designer 
        in web design, like designing websites and apps and maybe even doing some coding 
        if required.</p>
