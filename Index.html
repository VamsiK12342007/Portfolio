    <p>This is Vamsi Kurli and welcome to my portfolio site. I am in my final semester in Multimedia Design Development
        program from Humber College. I have also completed Film & Television diploma from SAIT, Calgary. I have completed 
        many assignments related to film, web & design works. Web & design related works were completed as part of 
        school assignments from Humber College and film related assignments in my diploma program. I have created this 
        portfolio for your review and to consider my candidature for an internship opportunity in your firm. Thank you.</p>
